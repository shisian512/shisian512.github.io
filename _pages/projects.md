# Notes

- Each entry above links to the most relevant public repo when available. For internal/closed-source work I can provide summaries, architecture diagrams, or code excerpts on request.  
- If you want compact, CV-style one-line summaries of these projects (for LinkedIn or an emailed portfolio), tell me which items to shorten and I’ll produce a condensed version.
