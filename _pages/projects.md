# Projects üöß  
*Some are polished. Some are still duct-taped. All are mine.*

## üõ†Ô∏è End-to-End Logistic Regression MLOps Pipeline  
**Role**: ML Engineer (Personal Project)  
**Duration**: Started July 2025 ‚Äî still ongoing  
**URL**: [GitHub ‚Äì mlops](https://github.com/shisian512/mlops)

Built from scratch (yes, with pain and glory) ‚Äî a full MLOps regression pipeline focused on the "real-world mess":  
- CI/CD automation  
- Experiment tracking with MLflow  
- Data & model versioning via DVC  
- Drift detection  
- Cloud-native deployment with Kubernetes  

Currently adding more chaos (Airflow, monitoring, maybe a robot arm). Trying to simulate production without actually breaking production.

## üìö Curriculum LLM Platform  
**Role**: Core Developer (Collaborated with Project Owner)  
**Duration**: Feb 2025 ‚Äì Jul 2025  

Also built from scratch ‚Äî a lightweight content delivery platform with:  
- Payload CMS (Node.js), Next.js frontend  
- Python FastAPI backend  
- Multi-env Docker setup (local/dev/staging) with GitHub Actions  
- Modular RAG pipeline (because static content is boring)

Designed for edge inference on Intel XPU devices ‚Äî think "LLM-on-the-go" kind of vibe.

‚ö†Ô∏è Internal tool, so no public repo. But yes, it *does* work and didn‚Äôt explode.

## üß† Enterprise GenAI Platform (Intel OPEA)  
**Role**: Core Developer (under Tech Lead Direction)  
**Duration**: Nov 2024 ‚Äì Jan 2025  
**URL**: [GitHub ‚Äì GenAIExamples](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIExamples)

Optimized containerized GenAI inferencing on Intel iGPU/dGPU (XPU):  
- Debugged docker container hell  
- Migrated workflows from `systemd` to `Docker Compose`  
- Reduced setup friction across teams  
- Built internal PoC demos to show off inferencing

## üîç AI Workload Validation (Intel WSF)  
**Role**: Validation Support Engineer  
**Duration**: Jul 2024 ‚Äì Oct 2025  
**URL**: [GitHub ‚Äì Workload Services Framework](https://github.com/intel/workload-services-framework)

Worked on validation support for AI workloads on Intel Xeon platforms:  
- Wrote and ran test cases  
- Helped triage bugs using JIRA (my best frenemy)  
- Helped stabilize and cover more edge cases in platform testing

Learned that testing is 30% logic, 70% caffeine.

## üé® Final Year Project ‚Äì Colorizing Grayscale Images with Deep Learning  
**Role**: Researcher  
**Duration**: Oct 2022 ‚Äì Jul 2023  
**More info**: [LinkedIn Project](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tan-shi-sian)

Built a conditional GAN model ("Colour Stack cGAN") to colorize grayscale images:  
- Literature review + model architecture from scratch  
- Trained using paired datasets (gray ‚Üî color)  
- Evaluated perceptual quality and accuracy  
- Use cases: restoring old photos, automatic media colorization, digital nostalgia

Presented at academic symposiums, and no one fell asleep ‚Äî a win.
