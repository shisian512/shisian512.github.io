My name is **Tan Shi Sian (Nick)**. I graduated with **First Class Honours in Computer Science (Software Engineering)** from Multimedia University, Malaysia.  
I have hands-on experience in **AI engineering, MLOps, and backend systems**, with professional exposure at Intel Corporation and Infineon Technologies.

At **Intel**, I worked as an AI Engineer where I built scalable backend platforms, engineered MLOps pipelines, and developed production-ready AI/ML solutions — from LLM applications to GenAI microservices.  
At **Infineon**, I interned as a Business Intelligence Developer, where I built automated ETL pipelines and Tableau dashboards that improved data availability and streamlined operational reporting.

My long-term career goal is to continue advancing in **AI/MLOps engineering**, building reliable, scalable, and impactful AI systems that bridge research and real-world applications.
