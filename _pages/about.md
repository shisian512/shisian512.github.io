# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Shi Sian Tan**, a machine learning engineer with too many tabs open â€” both in my browser and in my brain.

I build:
- systems that (usually) donâ€™t crash at 3AM  
- models that try to understand the world better than I do  
- pipelines that feel more stable than my sleep schedule  

---

## ðŸ¤– What I do (besides Googling error messages)

- Train models, deploy them, then regret not versioning them properly  
- Automate everything Iâ€™m too lazy to repeat twice  
- Talk to ChatGPT like itâ€™s a moody roommate  
- Solve problems nobody asked for, but someone someday might thank me for

---

## ðŸ§  Interests
- Using AI to solve actual problems (not just generate cat pictures â€” unless itâ€™s a *really* cool cat)  
- Making workflows smoother, smarter, and more dramatic than necessary  
- Collecting obscure ML tools I may or may not ever use

---

## â˜• Behind the scenes
- I like clean code, quiet environments, and chaotic ideas  
- I like coffee, peanut butter, and chocolate
- Most of my best thoughts happen **just before sleep**, which is very inconvenient for everyone involved

## ðŸ›¸ Contact

You wonâ€™t find me at parties, but you can find me here:
- [Projects](/projects/)
- [Contact](/contact/) (No spam. No small talk. Just signals.)

Or send a meme. That works too.  
(*Bonus points if it's AI-related and mildly cursed.*)
