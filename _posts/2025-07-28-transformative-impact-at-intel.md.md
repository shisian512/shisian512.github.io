üì¢ A Year of Transformative Impact: Three Pillars of Growth at Intel

<!--more-->

Over the past 12 months at Intel, I've had the privilege of contributing to three major AI-related initiatives, each significantly shaping my journey through real-world infrastructure, full-stack delivery, and deep technical challenges.

1Ô∏è‚É£ AI Workload Validation - Intel WSF
- Engineered inference pipelines utilizing Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible.
- Designed structured test cases and debugged performance bottlenecks for workloads on the Intel Xeon platform.
- Consistently delivered validation improvements in dynamic environments.
- Identified, reported, and tracked performance issues and bugs for diverse workloads in JIRA.
- This project highlighted the critical importance of cross-cultural communication and collaboration, working closely with our colleagues at Intel China.

2Ô∏è‚É£ GenAI Platform Deployment - Intel OPEA
- Deployed microservices across Intel GPU/iGPU platforms using Docker Compose, with optimizations from OpenVino / ipex-llm.
- Successfully migrated legacy systemd services to containers, significantly enhancing maintainability.
- Resolved issue related to OPEA project, directly improving deployment success rates.
- Gained in-depth knowledge of the OPEA platform and GPU hardware support expansion through close team collaboration.

3Ô∏è‚É£ LLM-Powered AI Platform with RAG Integration
- Developed robust full-stack features leveraging Next.js, FastAPI, and Payload CMS.
- Designed and implemented efficient backend APIs with FastAPI, focusing on robust data handling and complex logic.
- Contributed significantly to Payload CMS schema design, meticulously defining collections and fields to optimize content management and data structures for educational flows.
- Proposed and successfully shipped new features to support cutting-edge AI-driven education experiences.

üéì Professional Growth
Training: Completed "High Impact Conversation" by Wisdom Woods and "Positive Leadership" by IMMERSIVE.
Recognition: Served as Event ExCo at Intel Graduates Club, contributing to the team awarded "GAR Team of the Year."
Volunteering: Participated in the Penang International Science Fair 2024, representing Intel Booth.

üß† Key Takeaways
- Cultivating systems thinking from firmware to inference.
- Always build with purpose and focus on measurable impact.
- Understanding that great engineering equals continuous learning, strong ownership, and seamless collaboration.

I‚Äôm currently open to new opportunities where I can leverage my expertise in AI infrastructure, LLM deployment, or full-stack AI systems. I‚Äôm eager to contribute to innovative projects in the broader AI/ML development space.
