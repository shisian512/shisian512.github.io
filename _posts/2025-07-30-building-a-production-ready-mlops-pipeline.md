# 🚀 Building a Production-Ready MLOps Pipeline: From Data to Deployment

Over the past few weeks, I've been building a full-stack, production-oriented MLOps pipeline tailored for regression tasks. This is not just an academic exercise — my goal is to design and implement an end-to-end system that mirrors what real-world ML deployments demand: modularity, automation, reproducibility, and observability.

While the project is still a work in progress, it's becoming a valuable learning ground and a personal benchmark in my MLOps journey.

## 🔧 What Does the Pipeline Include?

The system covers the full lifecycle of an ML project — from data ingestion to deployment, with CI/CD and monitoring in place:

- Data Processing: pandas + DVC for version-controlled pipelines, because tracking data changes is just as important as tracking code changes.
- Model Training & Registry: scikit-learn + MLflow for experiment tracking and model management, so I can compare different models and versions without getting lost.
- Online Inference API: FastAPI, containerized with Docker for scalable serving.
- Interactive Dashboard: Streamlit for simple visualization and interaction.
- Monitoring & Alerts: Prometheus + Grafana for performance metrics and system health. So I'll know when something's wrong before it becomes a major problem.
- CI/CD & Automation: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
- Drift Detection: EvidentlyAI + Airflow for scheduled data and model drift checks.

## 💡 Why I’m Building This

There are three key motivations behind this project:

1.  To bridge the gap between experimentation and production — understanding how ML systems are built, deployed, and maintained in real-world scenarios.
2.  To get hands-on experience with modern MLOps tools and workflows — including data versioning, pipeline orchestration, observability, and CI/CD.
3.  To document and reflect on my learning process — including design decisions, trade-offs, implementation challenges, and lessons learned.

This project represents a milestone in my transition from model-centric development to system-level ML engineering.

> I use visual system diagrams to better understand component relationships and to track system evolution over time. It's an essential step in my workflow.

## 🛠️ It's Not About Perfection — It's About Progress

This project is intentionally public, imperfect, and iterative.

I'm documenting every step — the thinking behind design choices, integration pain points, and technical breakdowns — both as a reference for myself and to help others walking the same path.

Feel free to:
- Ask questions
- Share feedback
- Fork the repo and adapt it for your own use case
